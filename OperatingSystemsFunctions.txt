Operating systems functions: Providing a user interface. The user interface is the means in which you’ll interact and perceive your experience on the computer. The most common user interface is a graphical user interface. This is an arrangement in which the tasks and commands you want to do are filtered through designs and pictures representing the commands you’re trying to initiate. Another type of user interface is a command line interface. Command line interface enables the user to use the computer by typing commands. These commands cannot be spelled incorrectly and aren’t always intuitive.
managing programs. An operating system manages programs via single tasking or multitasking. A single tasking OS can only have one program open at a time. Most OS’s are multitasking systems. You can check your mail and use the internet to search something and type in a word document at the same time. 
coordinating tasks. The operating system will also determine the orders the tasks and programs are processed and places the non primary tasks in buffers. Documents to be printed would be sent to a buffer while items in front of those pages are being printed first.
